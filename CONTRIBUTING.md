# How to contribute?
First of all. Thank you for considering to contribute to this project. 

## Issues
You are welcome to state your wishes in terms of [isssues](https://github.com/ybrid/opus-swift/issues) in this project. Of course reporting of bugs is favored in this transparent way, too.

## Tests
We do not own all exisiting ios device types of the past and the future. So try running the script ```test.sh``` with your device configured in the script. Tell us about success or failure. Does the test script pass the tests on your mac? This will help us improve the power of this software.

## Tell us your needs
### package management
Currently we support integration with CocoaPods and Swift Package Manager. You may tell us which type of package management you use.
